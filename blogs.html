<h4> Love Education Day </h4>
<p>
    Usually, on the 12th of February every year, Ingqwele celebrate its occasion that is called ‘Love Education Day’ where students who come from indigence are given calculators, school uniforms and stationeries. On such occasions, students are not only advised to pursue careers that only require Mathematics and Physical Sciences, but also those that are well in-synch with their personalities. It is unwise to coerce a person into selecting a career that s/he does not even like. That is like asking a person who has no fingers to play a guitar. In so doing, we are of view that we are contributing into making a better South Africa with educated bureaucrats. Students who passed their matric are given registration fees as a symbol of showing appreciation and thanking them for the way they performed during their final examinations. This helps in reducing the number of matriculates who passed from staying at home due to being unable to pay registration fees.</p>
